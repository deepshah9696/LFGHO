## GhrossChain

GhrossChain is a payments website where users can easily send assets to receiver without being afraid of sending assets to wrong chain wrong address or even wrong asset


## Problem

1. **Lack of users choice:** Users don't have a control over their assets, let it be ERC20, ERC721
2. **Difficulty in Onboarding:** Onboarding new developers to web3 can be difficult since they have to hop on to m,ultiple bridges/swap and see if they are getting the assets that they want
3. **Losing assets** Receiver might lose assets if the sender is sending wrong assets to wrong chain/addressess.
